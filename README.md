ESE519 Fall 2013, Final Project, Group 8, Team Member: Fredy Monterroza, Jing Qiu, Ye Yang 

The goal of the project was to build a machine that could play the piano. We wanted to make the system compatible with any keyboard of similar dimensions so that all a user would have to do is slip the piano into place and the machine would play some tune. The major goals of the project were to build as low cost a system as possible, which in turn meant to use as few motors as possible and build a structure that mimics a hand (more closely, a finger) and to provide an interactive experience for the user.

This github repository is consist of two major part. The first one is the code on the mbed side. We used the MRK-master as the starting point. The second part is the Android Application for communicating with the mbed.
